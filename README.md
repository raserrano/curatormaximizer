## Reading the recent posts

Once an author and few posts have been analyzed lets say probably 1 hour after they were publish.
Each author will get a rate and also an specific time to get voted.
Posts with the highest rate will get pushed to a queue
this queue will sort posts by uptvote time. 
Once the upvote time gets hits an actual vote will be casted
The idea is to find the most efficient posts and vote them in the most efficient way
Authors that get flag frequetly will be filtered out
Authors that use bots wil get front run if its highly efficient
Will just keep the database simple and hopefully it will self clean
